On opening the launcher (CPP file), you will see a menu, enter ‘p’ to proceed and ‘.’ to exit. <br />
Thereafter enter your name that you wished to be displayed on the top of your screen. <br />
After entering your name the game LASSO will launch. You will be greeted with the Welcome Message. Click on ‘Instructions’ to view the controls. Else hit ‘T’ and click anywhere else to begin the game. <br />

CONTROLS <br />
‘t’ ->  loop throw <br />
‘y’->  yanking the loop <br />
‘\[‘ ->  decrease throw - angle <br />
‘\]’ ->  increase  throw – angle <br />
‘-‘ ->  lower the speed before throwing <br />
‘=’ -> increase the speed before throwing <br />
‘q’ -> exit menu <br />
<br />
INSTRUCTIONS <br />
Throw the lasso and try to catch the ball(s) according to the level. If you drop the lasso, or allow a ball to drop without yanking, you lose a life. Also don’t let the loop cross the rightmost wall (red edge), aka the wall of death. <br />
In the third level you will encounter red bombs. Do NOT catch them or you will lose another life.  <br />
Every ball that drops reduces the number of your life by one but this won’t happen (obviously) for the bombs. Also for each bomb you collect your lives and your score will reduce by one each. <br />
After exiting you will be able to see your net score. After that you may click anywhere to exit. <br />
Your score in any particular level will be visible in the top right corner. <br />
The Exit Menu – After you enter ‘q’ you will be taken to the exit menu. You may click on the ‘X’ in the top right corner to view your net score and exit, or click anywhere to resume. <br />
ENJOY! <br />
